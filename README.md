# BookWordCount
Above is the list of word count files for the novel bibliography for a selection of notable authors. 

Included is both JK Rowling and Robert Galbraith. Robert Galbraith is the penname of JK Rowling used to write her crime fiction novels after Harry Potter was over. How similar is her simple word frequency across her works? Could you have reasonable have detected she was the person behind Robert Galbraith?

Other authors are included for reference and to see if you can find any writing patterns with a simple word count file. This data does not include sentences, chapters, or parts of speech. However, the difference of writing patterns is still explorable with the data at hand.

All words were set to lowercase. No proper nouns were removed. The files were scrubbed of intros, page numbers, etc. but it is possible some errant book markings were not taken out.
